# FrilVault Architecture

## Overview

FrilVault is organized around a shared Rust core and thin integration surfaces.

- `crates/frilvault-core`: note model, repositories, services, runtime helpers
- `apps/frilvault-cli`: `flvt` command-line interface
- `apps/vscode-extension`: current editor integration
- `docs/`: architecture, workflow, testing, and release guidance

The current repository does not contain a desktop application source tree yet. Release and workflow documents may still refer to future desktop release work, but the active code surfaces in this checkout are the Rust core, CLI, and VS Code extension.

## Core Principles

- FrilVault is local-first. Notes and metadata stay inside the workspace.
- FrilVault does not modify source files.
- Business logic should live in `frilvault-core`.
- Editor and CLI layers should stay thin.

## Storage Model

```text
.vault/
├── notes/
├── index/
└── workspace.json
```

- `.vault/notes`: persisted note files
- `.vault/index`: workspace index data
- `.vault/workspace.json`: workspace-level metadata

## Runtime Shape

`VaultContext` is the current runtime container inside `frilvault-core`.

It currently owns:

- `NoteRepository`
- `WorkspaceIndexRepository`
- `NoteCache`

Its job is to centralize cache-aware note loading, index rebuild helpers, and workspace scans.

## Current Boundaries

### `frilvault-core`

The core crate owns:

- note CRUD
- note attachments
- note search
- note query and explorer DTOs
- note URI parsing and resolution
- symbol resolution helpers
- workspace stats and health
- workspace sync and gitignore helpers
- repair suggestions and repair application
- `.vault` persistence

### `frilvault-cli`

The CLI is the primary executable surface today.

- parses commands
- opens the workspace
- calls the `FrilVault` facade
- prints human or JSON output

### `apps/vscode-extension`

The VS Code extension is the current editor-facing integration.

Current feature scope:

- add note
- notes panel
- gutter decorations
- gutter actions
- note edit and delete
- inline note editor
- CodeLens note counts
- search
- note URI handling
- workspace stats
- workspace health
- repair apply
- workspace rename and watcher hooks
- workspace enable/disable state
- gitignore prompt on first persisted note flow

Its active backend is currently CLI-backed:

- add note
- notes panel
- gutter decorations
- inline editor mutations
- search
- stats
- health
- repair
- URI resolution
- workspace sync and rename-related flows

The `FrilVault: Add Note` command and the create-here flow both currently route through the inline editor path.

There is still native bridge scaffolding in the extension repo, but it is not the active runtime path. `src/core/nodeBridge.ts` is not part of extension activation today.

There is also a legacy `features/add-note` command/service path that is still covered by tests but is not part of the active extension command registration.

## Known Architectural Reality

The runtime boundary exists, but the project is still consolidating around shared core behavior.

- `NoteService` uses `VaultContext` for cache-aware file note loading
- note mutations still write through repositories stored inside the context
- note search still scans persisted note files directly
- `WorkspaceService` still keeps its own `WorkspaceIndexRepository` field
- the extension now centralizes current-file note state through a shared store, but its active behavior still shells out through the CLI boundary

That is acceptable for the current MVP, but it means the runtime layer is only partially unified.

## Current Risks

The following behaviors are important to release readiness in the current checkout:

- the VS Code URI handler decodes the `workspace` query before entering its guarded error path, so malformed percent-encoding can still escape as an exception
- the post-save `.gitignore` prompt shares the inline editor invalidation path, so a prompt/check failure can be surfaced to the user as if the note save failed even after persistence succeeded
- CodeLens path matching uses custom string slicing instead of the shared path helpers, which makes nested workspace-root overrides and Windows path handling more fragile than the rest of the extension
