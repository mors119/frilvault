# FrilVault

Personal notes for source code, without modifying source files.

FrilVault is a local-first workspace knowledge layer. Notes live under `.vault/` beside the project, while application code stays untouched.

## What It Supports

- line-anchored and symbol-anchored notes
- note attachments
- workspace search
- workspace explorer output
- workspace stats and health checks
- note URI resolution
- workspace sync and gitignore helper flows
- note-file repair after file moves or renames
- VS Code integration with notes panel, gutter markers, hover preview, inline editing, and CodeLens

## Repository Layout

```text
.
├── AGENTS.md
├── apps/
│   ├── frilvault-cli
│   └── vscode-extension
├── crates/
│   └── frilvault-core
└── docs/
```

- `crates/frilvault-core` contains the domain logic, persistence boundaries, symbol helpers, URI helpers, and workspace services.
- `apps/frilvault-cli` is the main executable surface for local workflows and JSON consumers.
- `apps/vscode-extension` contains the current editor integration.
- `docs/` contains architecture, workflow, testing, and release guidance.

The current checkout contains a CLI and a VS Code extension. Repository guidance still reserves room for a future desktop application, but there is no desktop application source tree in the current layout.

## Install

The current public release is `v0.0.2` for the VS Code extension.

### Option 1: Visual Studio Marketplace

Install `FrilVault` from the Visual Studio Marketplace inside VS Code.

Marketplace users do not need to choose a platform manually. The Marketplace serves the matching package for the current operating system and CPU architecture.

### Option 2: GitHub Release VSIX

Download a platform-specific VSIX from the GitHub Release page:

https://github.com/FrilLab/frilvault/releases

Then install it in VS Code with `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`.

### Supported Platforms

| Platform | VSIX target |
| --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `darwin-arm64` |
| macOS Intel | `darwin-x64` |
| Windows x64 | `win32-x64` |
| Linux x64 | `linux-x64` |

## Release Distribution

The repository uses a split release flow for the VS Code extension:

- `release.yml` runs when a GitHub Release is published and builds platform-specific VSIX assets
- `publish.yml` is a manual workflow that downloads those Release assets and publishes them to the Visual Studio Marketplace with `VSCE_PAT`

Each published GitHub Release attaches these VSIX packages:

- `frilvault-<version>-darwin-arm64.vsix`
- `frilvault-<version>-darwin-x64.vsix`
- `frilvault-<version>-linux-x64.vsix`
- `frilvault-<version>-win32-x64.vsix`

## Current Notes

FrilVault `v0.0.2` removes the separate CLI installation requirement for supported VS Code installs by bundling `flvt` inside each platform-specific package.

## Storage Model

```text
.vault/
├── notes/
├── index/
└── workspace.yml
```

FrilVault does not rewrite or annotate source files.

## Quick Commands

```bash
flvt add --file src/main.rs --line 10 --column 5 --content "parser needs cleanup"
flvt explorer --format json
flvt list --file src/main.rs
flvt search parser
flvt resolve-uri "frilvault://note/..."
flvt stats
flvt doctor
flvt repair --apply
```

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --workspace --release
```

```bash
cd apps/vscode-extension
npm install
npm run check-types
npm run lint
npm run compile
npm test
```

Use `npm run check-types`, not `npm run typecheck`; that script does not exist in the current extension package.
